ActionScript framework to overcome AS2 movieclip inheritence by composition

## History
Back in the days of action script 2 programming, adding extra functionality to movieclip was a pain. This framework is written to overcome this problem by using composition, much like angularjs is now using directives for dom elements.

This framework served me well for my as2 projects. I would like to think that it is not useless now, and I hope some of the concepts in it will inspire other projects.
